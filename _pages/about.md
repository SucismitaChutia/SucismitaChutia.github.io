I am a computational physicist with a strong interest in data science stemming from my past work analysing large data sets during my research. I am also an experienced programmer and scientific software developer versed in high performance computing and a number of programming languages including R and Python. 

Some of my data science projects are show-cased in the portfolio section of this website.
