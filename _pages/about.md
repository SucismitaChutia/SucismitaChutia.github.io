I am a computational physicist with a strong interest in data science stemming from my past work analysing large data sets during my research. I am also an experienced programmer and scientific software developer versed in high performance computing and a number of programming languages including R and Python. 

After a career break to raise my child, I am ready to return to work. I have been upskilling myself for data science roles by taking online courses on Datacamp.com so that I am familiar with the full data processing lifecycle.

Some of my data science projects are show-cased in the Data Science Portfolio section of this website.
