Portfolio of data science projects using R and Jupyter notebooks demonstrating the usage of data cleaning, manipulation, exploration, visualization, and modeling on a variety of datasets. Each folder contains a standalone project with datasets and a notebook with real-world applications. These guided projects from Datacamp.com have been worked on independently and the solutions are not provided by DataCamp.
