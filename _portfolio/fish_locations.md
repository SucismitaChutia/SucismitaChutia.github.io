##  Where are the fishes

Marine scientists use backscatter to understand the distribution of organisms in the ocean. This project analyses active acoustic data collected from a research vessel that crossed the shelf break in the Mid-Atlantic Bight and plots the mean volume backscatter associated with fish with swim-bladders in relation to the depth of the sea floor.
