## TV, Halftime Shows and the Big Game

Analysis of data from the Super Bowl Halftime shows, the American football extravaganza.

After exploring and cleaning the data, we're going to answer questions like:

 * What are the most extreme game outcomes?
 * How does the score difference affect television viewership?
 * How have viewership, TV ratings, and advertisement costs evolved?
 * Who are the most prolific musicians in terms of halftime show performances?
