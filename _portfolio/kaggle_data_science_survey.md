## Exploring the Kaggle Data Science Survey

Throughout the world of data science, there are many languages and tools that can be used to complete a given task.  This project analyses what tools and languages professionals use in their day-to-day work. The data comes from the Kaggle Data Science Survey which includes responses from over 10,000 people that write code to analyse data in their daily work.
